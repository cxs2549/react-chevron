					<strong>San Ramon, Calif., October 11, 2021</strong> — Chevron Corporation
					(NYSE: CVX) issued an updated climate change resilience report that further
					details the company’s ambition to advance our lower carbon future. Chevron
					adopted a 2050 net zero aspiration for equity upstream Scope 1 and 2 emissions.
					The TCFD-aligned report describes how Chevron is incorporating Scope 3 emissions
					into its greenhouse gas emission targets by establishing a Portfolio Carbon
					Intensity (PCI) target inclusive of Scope 1 and 2 as well as Scope 3 emissions*
					from the use of its products.
				</p>
				<p>
					“Solutions start with problem solving, which is exactly what the people of
					Chevron do – and have excelled at for over 140 years,” said Michael Wirth,
					Chevron’s chairman and CEO. “This report offers further insights about our
					strategy, how we are investing in lower-carbon businesses and why we believe
					this is an exciting time to be in the energy industry.”
				</p>
				<p>
					Chevron’s new PCI target assists with transparent carbon accounting and company
					comparison from publicly available data. The target covers the full value chain,
					including Scope 3 emissions from the use of products. The company has set a
					greater than 5 percent carbon emissions intensity reduction target from 2016
					levels by 2028. This target is aligned with Chevron’s strategy which allows
					flexibility to grow its traditional business, provided it remains increasingly
					carbon-efficient, and pursue growth in lower-carbon businesses. Chevron plans to
					publish a PCI methodology document and online tool to enable third parties to
					calculate PCI for energy companies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Chevron’s 2050 equity upstream Scope 1 and 2 net zero aspiration builds on the
					company’s disciplined approach to target setting and action. The path to this
					net zero aspiration anticipates partnerships with multiple stakeholders and
					progress in technology, policy, regulations, and offset markets.
				</p>
				<p>
					“We regularly engage with stakeholders and investors to understand their views
					and to be responsive to their increasing expectations on all issues, including
					ESG,” said Dr. Ronald Sugar, Chevron’s lead director. “Our updated report
					demonstrates our goal to partner with many stakeholders to work toward a lower
					carbon future.”{' '}

					* Scope 1 includes direct emissions of the six Kyoto Protocol greenhouse gases
					(GHG)--carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), sulfur
					hexafluoride, perfluorocarbons, and hydrofluorocarbons. Scope 2 includes
					indirect GHG emissions from imported electricity and steam. Scope 3 includes
					other indirect emissions, including use of products. The PCI includes Scope 3
					emissions from the use of products. More information is available in our updated{' '}

					Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially
					from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing crude oil and
					natural-gas prices and demand for our products, and production curtailments due
					to market conditions; crude oil production quotas or other actions that might be
					imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other
					producing countries; technological advancements; changes to government policies
					in the countries in which the company operates; development of large carbon
					capture and offsets markets; public health crises, such as pandemics and
					epidemics, and related government policies and actions; changing economic,
					regulatory, and political environments in the various countries in which the
					company operates; general domestic and international economic and political
					conditions; changing refining, marketing, and chemicals margins; the company’s
					ability to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions, and
					efficiencies associated with enterprise transformation initiatives; actions of
					competitors or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of crude oil
					liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or product
					substitutes; the results of operations and financial condition of the company’s
					suppliers, vendors, partners, and equity affiliates; the inability or failure of
					the company’s joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and
					development activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production
					from existing and future crude oil and natural-gas development projects;
					potential delays in the development, construction, or startup of planned
					projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company’s operations
					due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe weather, cyber
					threats, terrorist acts, or other natural or human causes beyond the company’s
					control; the potential liability for remedial actions or assessments under
					existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; significant
					operational, investment, or product changes required by existing or future
					environmental statutes and regulations, including international agreements and
					national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit or reduce
					greenhouse gas emissions; the potential liability resulting from pending or
					future litigation; the company’s future acquisitions or dispositions of assets
					or shares or the delay or failure of such transactions to close based on
					required closing conditions; the potential for gains and losses from asset
					dispositions or impairments; government-mandated sales, divestitures,

					authorizations to pay future dividends; the effects of changed accounting rules
					under generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting
					bodies; the company’s ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards
					inherent in operating in the global energy industry; and the factors set forth
					under the heading “Risk Factors” on pages 18 through 23 of the 2020 Annual
